In this summary, we summarized the following papers [1], [2], and [3]. The topics covered are related to STRIPS [11], GraphPlan [2], and Planning as Heuristic Search [3].



**STRIPS**



Like many solutions in AI, approaches to tackle planning came from a combination of knowledge and learnings from various fields. In Classical Planning, state space search, theorem proving, and control theory [4] are widely used.

Classical Planning in AI pertains to the task of setting out a course of actions that are available to the agent to reach a certain goal or meet a specified criteria [6]. However, planning is generally known to be intractable problems [5]. As part of this, researchers broke down the problem into simpler environments to handle the complexity of the problem [1] by coming up with STRIPS. For example, working with problems within the environment where there is a single agent, static, deterministic, and fully observable allows us to understand the nature of the problem and add more complexity via loosening the constraints on the environment, such as multiple agents, stochastic, changing, and partially observability. This can be seen by the extensions made to STRIPS via Sacerdoti [10] with abstract planning with ABSTRIPS and frameworks for dynamic environments constructed as an extension to STRIPS by Hendrix [12] and Pednault [13]. 

Moving our focus back to STRIPS, in the SRI AI laboratory during the last 1960s, there was an initiative to create a mobile robot. This project sparked a variety of ideas that started many of the key ideas that are still fundamental to how we approach solving AI problems. For example, this is where Hart et al. [7] developed the A * search algorithm, and Fikes and Nilsson [8] developed the STanford Research Institute Problem Solver (STRIPS) [1] automatic plan generator.

 In-depth explanation of how STRIPS works can be found in its introductory paper [11]. On a high level, STRIPS works by representing the world as an arbitrary collection of first-order logical formulas. There are operators that are actionable if the current state matches the precondition formula(s) specified in the precondition list of logical formulas of the operator. Each operator has its own addition and deletion list of formulas. These set of operators define the domain space and the goals and initial condition defines the problem space.

Since it inception, STRIPS became a foundation to many other automatic plan generators in static, single-agent environments. Within the domain of using propositional logic based representation and state-space search, one of the key contributions by STRIPS was containing the effects of operators / actions to only those that were explicitly specified in the addition and deletion list of an operator [1].



**GraphPlan**



One of the key innovations that improved time to find a good plan in STRIPS-like domain was GraphPlan [2]. With GraphPlan, instead of starting a state-space search, initially, it creates a planning graph, prior to finding a solution. At start, beginning with the initial condition of the problem (forming the first level), it creates another level including all the operators that can be performed irrespective of mutual exclusivity (mutex), while keeping track of the mutex. The addition list of each operator and existing preconditions from the previous level form the next level. We then repeat this on the next level until we level out.

GraphPlan is a planning graph that in essence, is a constraint graph that encodes the planning problem [2]. Among others, this is mainly because, unlike the optimal plan graph generated by traditional state-space systematic search algorithms, GraphPlan does not have the constraint of executing one action at a time. But also, as it builds its graph, it can much quickly validate that if a problem is solvable [2].

The paper proposed that GraphPlan find its solution via backward-chaining strategy. It uses the mutex and available actions to formulate the list of actions to solve the problem by starting at the end of the graph and going backwards by ensuring that the goal condition(s)' preconditions are not mutually exclusive in the previous level. As it traverses the graph to the initial condition, it constructs the list of actions to reach the solution conditions.

When observing the CPU time and explored states and compare it to other popular planners such as Prodigy and UCPOP with heuristics, GraphPlan performs extremely well.

Even with all its improvements, GraphPlan sometimes fails to find the most optimal solution. Also, it can be cumbersome to create the whole graph when the possible operators are too numerous due to the problem domain size, causing the initial planning graph step to be expensive.



**Planning as Heuristic Search**



The key idea of heuristic plan search is the aspect of domain independence [3]. Unlike specialized solvers for Rubik's cube and Sokoban, where they have heuristic functions implemented specifically for that problem domain, planner heuristics are generated by extracting these insights from the declarative problem representations, e.g. the logical formulas in STRIPS. The key idea here is to relax the constraints of each operator by not applying the delete lists, or preconditions. In [3], they focus on ignoring delete lists.

One aspect that the best first search heuristic search does not do well is planning for optimizing concurrent action execution. This can be seen with IPP [14], STAN [15], and BLACKBOX [16]. In this paper, they focus on heuristics with best first search for non-optimal sequential planning. They ran multiple experiments in multiple domains comparing the performances between STAN, BLACKBOX, hill-climbing heuristic planner (HSP), and A* heuristic planner (HSP2).

The types of problems and the type of heuristic function makes a difference. This can be seen by how the additive heuristic of ignore delete list used in HSP2 in domains that includes subgoals that are independent, such as Logistics and Gripper problem, the additive heuristic does not overestimate, thus being closer to admissible. This lack of overestimation causes the planner to expand too many nodes, thus taking too long.

The paper also investigated the merits of forward vs backwards planning, but concluded that forward planning was more advantageous due to the disadvantage of creating spurious states in backward search, and the information gained in recomputing the atom costs on forward searching.

There has been efforts [17] to focus on deriving heuristics automatically when encountering different problems via relaxing different preconditions to find the best heuristic for a specific problem.

It is interesting how although GraphPlan's initial paper [2] mentioned its potential use as heuristic, it didn't dig into that aspect initially. However, in subsequent papers, such as [3], it digs into the power of GraphPlan's initial plan graph as a source of heuristic for a systematic search algorithm, and its potential.

Overall, a simple state space search algorithm with forward searching and heuristics was competitive in some types of problems. The performance measure was based on the time it took to create the plan and the number of steps in the generated plan. However, the challenges to keep improving heuristic based search is based on the limitations of the modeling language, STRIPS, and how the domain-independent heuristics could be generated. This is because, the automatic generation of heuristic is closely tied to the nature of the modeling language for the planner.
